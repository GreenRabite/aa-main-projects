      In the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana is often served as an entree,
       and sometimes with a side of or on top of pasta. Many restaurants also offer chicken parm sandwiches.[12] Upon arriving in America, Italian immigrants began to take advantage of America's affordable meat market, incorporating chicken into the Parmigiana.[13] A recipe for chicken parmigiana was published in The New York Times in 1962.[14] The New York Public Library has in their collection a menu from New York City Italian restaurant that has been in the same location since 1906 which shows that chicken parmigiana was being offered in 1958.[15] In the same collection at the New York Public Library, there is a menu from a restaurant on board an ocean liner of the Italian Line that crossed the North Atlantic between North America and Europe and had offered Petti Di Pollo Alla Parmigiana in 1956.[16] There is a recipe that was published in the 1953 issue of the New York Herald Tribune that used frozen fried chicken patties or fillets along with other pre-processed foods to make a version of the dish at home.
